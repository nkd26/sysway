			Prehistoric Acheulian tools dating to Lower Paleolithic era have been discovered in various places in the region, implying an early settlement by humans.[27] Kalinga has been mentioned in ancient texts like Mahabharata, Vayu Purana and Mahagovinda Suttanta.[28][29] The Sabar people of Odisha have also been mentioned in the Mahabharata.[30][31] Baudhayana mentions Kalinga as not yet being influenced by Vedic traditions, implying it followed mostly tribal traditions.[32]<br><br>


Hathigumpha on the Udayagiri Hills built in c. 150 BCE<br><br>

Shanti Stupa at Dhauli is the location where Kalinga War was fought in c. 260 BCE<br><br>
Ashoka of the Mauryan dynasty conquered Kalinga in the bloody Kalinga War in 261 BCE,[33] which was the eighth year of his reign.[34] According to his own edicts, in that war about 100,000 people were killed, 150,000 were captured and more were affected.[33] The resulting bloodshed and suffering of the war is said to have deeply affected Ashoka. He turned into a pacifist and converted to Buddhism.[34][35]<br>

By c. 150 BCE, emperor Kharavela, who was possibly a contemporary of Demetrius I of Bactria,[36] conquered a major part of the Indian sub-continent. Kharavela was a Jain ruler. He also built the monastery atop the Udayagiri hill.[37] Subsequently, the region was ruled by monarchs, such as Samudragupta[38] and Shashanka.[39] It was also a part of Harsha's empire.[40]<br><br>

The city of Brahmapur in Odisha is also known to have been the capital of the Pauravas during the closing years of 4th Century A.D. Nothing was heard from the Pauravas from about the 3rd Century A.D, because they were annexed by the Yaudheya Republic, who in turn submitted to the Mauryans. It was only at the end of 4th century A.D, that they established royalty at Brahmapur, after about 700 years.<br><br>

Later, the kings of the Somavamsi dynasty began to unite the region. By the reign of Yayati II, c. 1025 CE, they had integrated the region into a single kingdom. Yayati II is supposed to have built the Lingaraj temple at Bhubaneswar.[17] They were replaced by the Eastern Ganga dynasty. Notable rulers of the dynasty were Anantavarman Chodaganga, who began re-construction on the present-day Shri Jagannath Temple in Puri (c. 1135), and Narasimhadeva I, who constructed the Konark temple (c. 1250).[41][42]<br><br>
