					<li>It saves you time. If you spend a lot of your time answering emails or social media queries, an FAQ can be a real timesaver. It can also help prevent costly and time-consuming returns in your online store. </li>

					<li>It brings new website traffic and new customers. Google’s goal is to deliver answers to questions. If you put your text in a Q&A format, you’re doing half the work already. Even better, if you have a good answer to a question, you might get featured in one of Google’s answer boxes or feature snippets, which will give you a big traffic boost.</li>

					<li>It builds trust and shows that you get it: A well-written FAQ page shows experience. You know what customers are thinking and you’ve already got an answer. It’s a great way to increase the trust and professionalism of your website.</li>
					<li>Use “FAQ” or “Frequently Asked Questions” as the page title</li>
					<li>Write questions from the point of view of your customer</li>
					<li>Write the FAQ sheet in an actual question-and-answer format</li>
					<li>Keep answers short</li>
					<li>Fully answer the question, don’t just link to a different page</li>
					<li>Start your answers to yes/no questions with a “yes” or a “no”</li>
					<li>Avoid jargon—write like your customers talk</li>
					<li>Show some personality in your answers</li>
