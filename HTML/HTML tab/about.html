				Prehistoric Acheulian tools dating to Lower Paleolithic era have been discovered in various places in the region, implying an early settlement by humans.[27] Kalinga has been mentioned in ancient texts like Mahabharata, Vayu Purana and Mahagovinda Suttanta.[28][29] The Sabar people of Odisha have also been mentioned in the Mahabharata.[30][31] Baudhayana mentions Kalinga as not yet being influenced by Vedic traditions, implying it followed mostly tribal traditions.[32]<br><br>


Hathigumpha on the Udayagiri Hills built in c. 150 BCE<br><br>

Shanti Stupa at Dhauli is the location where Kalinga War was fought in c. 260 BCE<br><br>
Ashoka of the Mauryan dynasty conquered Kalinga in the bloody Kalinga War in 261 BCE,[33] which was the eighth year of his reign.[34] According to his own edicts, in that war about 100,000 people were killed, 150,000 were captured and more were affected.[33] The resulting bloodshed and suffering of the war is said to have deeply affected Ashoka. He turned into a pacifist and converted to Buddhism.[34][35]<br>

By c. 150 BCE, emperor Kharavela, who was possibly a contemporary of Demetrius I of Bactria,[36] conquered a major part of the Indian sub-continent. Kharavela was a Jain ruler. He also built the monastery atop the Udayagiri hill.[37] Subsequently, the region was ruled by monarchs, such as Samudragupta[38] and Shashanka.[39] It was also a part of Harsha's empire.[40]<br><br>

The city of Brahmapur in Odisha is also known to have been the capital of the Pauravas during the closing years of 4th Century A.D. Nothing was heard from the Pauravas from about the 3rd Century A.D, because they were annexed by the Yaudheya Republic, who in turn submitted to the Mauryans. It was only at the end of 4th century A.D, that they established royalty at Brahmapur, after about 700 years.<br><br>

Later, the kings of the Somavamsi dynasty began to unite the region. By the reign of Yayati II, c. 1025 CE, they had integrated the region into a single kingdom. Yayati II is supposed to have built the Lingaraj temple at Bhubaneswar.[17] They were replaced by the Eastern Ganga dynasty. Notable rulers of the dynasty were Anantavarman Chodaganga, who began re-construction on the present-day Shri Jagannath Temple in Puri (c. 1135), and Narasimhadeva I, who constructed the Konark temple (c. 1250).[41][42]<br><br>

The Eastern Ganga Dynasty was followed by the Gajapati Kingdom. The region resisted integration into the Mughal empire until 1568, when it was conquered by Sultanate of Bengal.[43] Mukunda Deva, who is considered the last independent king of Kalinga, was defeated and was killed in battle by a rebel Ramachandra Bhanja. Ramachandra Bhanja himself was killed by Bayazid Khan Karrani.[44] In 1591, Man Singh I, then governor of Bihar, led an army to take Odisha from the Karranis of Bengal. They agreed to treaty because their leader Qutlu Khan Lohani had recently died. But, they then broke the treaty by attacking the temple town of Puri. Man Singh returned in 1592 and pacified the region.[45]

In 1751, the Nawab of Bengal Alivardi Khan ceded the region to the Maratha Empire.[17]<br><br>

The British had occupied the Northern Circars, comprising the southern coast of Odisha, as a result of the Second Carnatic War by 1760, and incorporated them into the Madras Presidency gradually.[46] In 1803, the British ousted the Marathas from the Puri-Cuttack region of Odisha during the Second Anglo-Maratha War. The northern and western districts of Odisha were incorporated into the Bengal Presidency.[47]<br><br>

The Orissa famine of 1866 caused an estimated 1 million deaths.[48] Following this, large-scale irrigation projects were undertaken.[49] In 1903, the Utkal Sammilani organisation was founded to demand the unification of Odia-speaking regions into one state.[50] On 1 April 1912, the Bihar and Orissa Province was formed.[51] On 1 April 1936, Bihar and Orissa were split into separate provinces.[52] The new province of Orissa came into existence on a linguistic basis during the British rule in India, with Sir John Austen Hubback as the first governor.[52][53] Following India's independence, on 15 August 1947, 27 princely states signed the document to join Orissa.[54] Most of the Orissa Tributary States, a group of princely states, acceded to Orissa in 1948, after the collapse of the Eastern States Union.[55]
