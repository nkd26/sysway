<p>A <b>robot</b> is a machine especially one programmable by a 
computer capable of carrying out a complex series of actions
automatically.<sup>[2]</sup> Robots can be guided by an external control
device or the control may be embedded within. Robots may be 
constructed on the lines of human form, but most robots are 
machines designed to perform a task with no regard to their aesthetics.</p>

<strong>Robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous and range from humanoids such as Honda's Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility (ASIMO) 
and TOSY's TOSY Ping Pong Playing Robot (TOPIO) to industrial robots, medical operating robots, patient assist robots, dog therapy 
robots, collectively programmed swarm robots, UAV drones such as General Atomics MQ-1 Predator, and even microscopic nano robots.
By mimicking a lifelike appearance or automating movements, a robot may convey a sense of intelligence or thought of its own. 
Autonomous things are expected to proliferate in the coming decade,[3] with home robotics and the autonomous car as some of the
main drivers.[4]</strong>

<p>The branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots,[5] as well as computer 
systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing is robotics. These technologies deal with automated machines
that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes, or resemble humans in appearance, behavior, 
or cognition. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics. These robots have also 
created a newer branch of robotics: soft robotics.</p>

<h2>Early beginnings</h2>
<p>Many ancient mythologies, and most modern religions include artificial people, such as the mechanical servants built by the Greek god
 Hephaestus[19] (Vulcan to the Romans), the clay golems of Jewish legend and clay giants of Norse legend, and Galatea, the mythical statue
 of Pygmalion that came to life. Since circa 400 BC, myths of Crete include Talos, a man of bronze who guarded the island from pirates.</p>

<p>In ancient Greece, the Greek engineer Ctesibius (c. 270 BC) "applied a knowledge of pneumatics and hydraulics to produce the first organ
 and water clocks with moving figures."[20][21] In the 4th century BC, the Greek mathematician Archytas of Tarentum postulated a mechanical
  steam-operated bird he called "The Pigeon". Hero of Alexandria (10–70 AD), a Greek mathematician and inventor, created numerous user-
  configurable automated devices, and described machines powered by air pressure, steam and water.[22]</p>
